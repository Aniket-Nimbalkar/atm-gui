# atm-gui
In this project, we aim to develop an ATM interface program using Java. 
This project will simulate the functionalities of a real ATM machine, providing users with a secure and intuitive way to perform banking operations.
The ATM interface program will allow users to perform various banking operations
such as checking balance, withdrawing money, and depositing money.
• Users will be prompted to enter their user ID and PIN upon startup for authentication.
• Upon successful authentication, users will gain access to the ATM functionalities.
• Error handling mechanisms will be implemented to handle invalid user input,
insufficient funds, etc.
• The program will provide informative messages to guide users through the ATM
interface.
